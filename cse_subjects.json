We will examine the origins and organisation of all this life, and learn the principles that allow you to make sense of biodiversity. In lectures, we will expose you to the vital basic knowledge required for understanding scientific principles of plant and animal biology, which is designed as an introduction allowing you to conduct more advanced and specialised studies later. In the laboratories, you will review these principles, and be exposed to examples of biodiversity in all its wonder and complexity. You will learn the basic features of animals and plants.",

Introduction to Aquaculture discusses the scope and role of aquaculture for increasing food and profit yields of marine, brackish and freshwater organisms. This subject integrates laboratory and field based learning so that students benefit from varied circumstances, contact and settings. Students maintain their own aquaculture organisms (fish or crustaceans, depending on availability) in an intensive aquaculture system. Students will develop practical animal husbandry skills and report writing skills. The course coordinator/lecturer has considerable experience in the aquaculture industry and associated wild fisheries. The biological principles of aquaculture including species selection, hatchery breeding and rearing and grow-out practices. Aquaculture technology and systems, overseas experience and Australian potential are addressed.",

It also addresses how to develop and implement sustainable aquaculture systems. Therefore, as a result of studying this subject, students will be able to critically assess the environmental sustainability and suitability of existing and developing aquaculture industries, as well as quantify the benefits of sustainable aquaculture practices. This subject integrates field and laboratory based learning so that students benefit from varied circumstances, contact and settings. Each day of this intensive is centred around one main sustainability theme which is delivered by experts in that area. The course coordinator has considerable experience in the aquaculture industry, and aquatic animal health.",

In lectures, we will expose you to the vital basic knowledge required for understanding scientific principles of plant and animal biology, which is designed as an introduction allowing you to conduct more advanced and specialised studies later. In the laboratories, you will review these principles, and be exposed to examples of biodiversity in all its wonder and complexity. You will learn the basic features of animals and plants.",

It influences every aspect of an organism's form and behaviour, and therefore is important for every field of biology, from marine and terrestrial biology and ecology through to conservation, aquaculture, molecular genetics, and even human health. This subject examines the evolutionary processes that have given rise to the diversity of life on earth; including the diversification and adaptation of populations to their surrounding environments and the rise of new species. Theory and techniques derived from evolutionary biology underpin many other fields in biology, and are being increasingly used in the conservation and management of threatened species and ecosystems. Knowledge of evolutionary processes is therefore essential for understanding and predicting how organisms will respond to increasing anthropogenic pressures and global change.",

A rounded education in any ecological or conservation field requires awareness of the current use and future potential of genetic techniques. This subject introduces the student to these uses. Uses of molecular phylogenies and population genetic data will be introduced to demonstrate how these can trace the evolutionary history of a group and assist in biodiversity and conservation studies. Factors affecting the genetic structure of species will be covered, including the effects of social structure and population subdivision on gene flow. There is an emphasis on the use of genetic approaches to setting conservation priorities and in management of endangered populations.",

It will cover the data communication protocols between devices and platforms: 1) Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), which is a machine-to-machine connectivity protocol; 2) Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), a standard-based low power wide area (LPWA) technology developed to enable a wide range of new IoT devices and services; and 3) RESTful API, an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. The second part of this subject will cover how to propose an idea with both technological advantages and business opportunities, how to write a grant application to attract business investors, and how to quickly develop prototypes of their new inventions with an enterprise IoT platform. Overall, this subject is about boosting students' innovation and business skills and nurturing their commercial aspirations.",

Characterisation of organometallic compounds is described with particular emphasis on multinuclear NMR and infrared spectroscopies and how these can be applied to study bonding in such molecules. The section on bioinorganic chemistry covers the importance of transition metals in metallo-proteins and enzymes, the reasons behind the use of metals in these species, the possible applications of synthetic analogues of these metalloproteins and metalloenzymes and the use of transition metal complexes in medicine as either therapeutic or diagnostic agents (e.g. MRI or radionuclide contrast agents). Content includes aspects of the reaction kinetics, redox behaviour and Lewis acidity of transition metal ions. Methods of structural and electronic characterisation of metalloproteins and enzymes including X-ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy , infrared and Raman, EPR, Mossbauer, and synchrotron techniques such as EXAFS are described and applied.",

        "description": "Safety, environmental and sustainability issues are critical concerns for engineers in industry. Designing and operating safe and sustainable systems that enhance society and the environment in which those systems are situated, are key skills that must be developed. The genesis of those skills find their place in the undergraduate curriculum, and are especially focussed upon in this subject. CL4040 is divided into two halves. The first is concerned with developing the skill of risk management for decision making to analyse, assess and improve the safety characteristics of socio-technical chemical process systems. This includes learning from past accidents in the chemical industry, hazard identification, quantitative consequence and frequency analyses, evaluating risk and making a design as to how to treat the risk. Safety risk assessment and treatment involves consideration of inherently safer design principles. Importantly, the limitations to the effectiveness of traditional risk assessment practices will be discussed, to encourage the students to develop a realistic appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of the tools they are using. The second half of the subject focusses on environmental impacts and sustainability. It is designed to develop students with skills in life cycle assessment, pollution control technologies in air, water and land. It also covers the basic philosophy, principles and practical guidelines for sustainable development of industries. A key theme running through this subject is to make the students aware of their responsibilities as an engineer across safety, environment and sustainability issues and practices.",

Students will develop essential design skills of creating, imaging, generating, iterating, communicating and consolidating. Collaboratively students will work together in teams to design, iterate, implement and validate computing solutions. Through projects, students will develop problem-solving skills, communication skills, presentation skills, project management skills and also build creative systems for a range of applications. Students will learn basic approaches to creative group problem solving working in teams in the form of a \"sprint\" event. The Sprint environment will provide students with an opportunity to develop these skills via a short-term 2-day design sprint to collectively analyse a problem then design and partially implement a practical solution, which is a mandatory part of this subject.",

        "description": "This subject is one of two capstones offered through the Work Integrated Learning (WIL) Program for Information Technology. The subject enables final year students to work together in groups to investigate and develop an IT related project sourced from industry. Capstone subjects allow students to apply and integrate the knowledge, skills and capabilities learned throughout their Bachelor of Information Technology degree while at the same time fostering the development of professional identities and transition to the workplace. Identification of suitable projects occurs through collaboration between the College and industry partner organisations. Students work in groups of up to six with each group having a mix of majors. Students are advised of their allocated group in the first timetabled workshop. It is a requirement that students attend the 3 hour timetabled workshop each week. Students conduct project work in addition to this contact time and receive support and project direction from academics and industry partner for the project's duration. External students are not eligible to enrol in this subject. Students at JCUS should consult Academic Staff.",

Students will learn the language of cyber resilience and the potential threats to organisations, gaining an active understanding of the cyber threat landscape and the planning and testing of response scenarios. The concept of 'responsive governance' is also being explored. In a rapidly changing cyber risk environment, in fact, the policies and procedures of today are not necessarily valid for long periods of time and may not remain valid between typical annual review cycles, hence students need to learn how to adapt to an ever evolving scenario.",

Plants and controllers are modelled using the z-transform which leads to rational transfer functions allowing for the usual pole/zero terminology and system performance specification and analysis. <b>Section B</b> - Modern Controller Design: Uses modern (time-domain state space) techniques in the analysis and design of controllers for continuous time plants. This section starts with developing state models of systems from both physical properties and transfer functions. It then investigates techniques for the design of controllers for systems that are modelled in state-space form such as the pole-placement technique. Associated with this are the concepts of controllability, observability and state feedback controller design",

Systems Engineering is a rigorous, repeatable and methodical approach to solving the complex technical problems often encountered in industry and beyond. The approach starts with an identification of a problem and the need for a new or improved system to be developed. This problem is explored and understood before the requirements for the new or improved system are to be developed and then analysed and articulated clearly. Potential solutions to the problem are then identified and evaluated against the requirements before a preferred solution is selected for subsequent design and development. Systems Engineering is a multi-disciplinary and collaborative approach to engineering and aims to develop solutions that not only meet requirements but are also balanced across the entire system lifecycle (including production, utilisation, support and disposal phases). Systems Engineering also closely links and integrates with non-technical disciplines and in particular Project Management. Project Management methodology and tools and techniques are explored through project life cycle and phases; activity networks; time management; cost management; physical resource management; quality management; contract management; project monitoring, information and control systems and sustainable practices",

The complementary numerical theory and application sections will be taught in parallel during the semester to provide context for one another and to expose graduates to the wide variety of numerical tools available to today's engineers. Within the theory section of the subject, students will learn the fundamentals and implementation of a variety of numerical methods; specifically the finite element method (FEM) and the discrete element method (DEM). The main topics of FEM include: matrix analysis methods; the derivation of element stiffness matrices of spring and bar elements as well as stiffness matrices of quadrilateral elements for plane elasticity, shell and solid elements; work equivalent forces; the concept of natural coordinates and isoparametric element formulation; numerical integration and gauss points and for DEM include: introduction to DEM and its applications, hard particle collision dynamics in DEM, classic and regularized Coulomb laws. Students are exposed to the theory underlying the FEM and DEM. Therefore, upon successful completion of this subject students can conceptualize alternative FEM and DEM procedures for different projects and ensure that used methods are based on fundamental principles. In the application proportion of the subject, students will be trained in the use of the ANSYS commercial FEM package for static and dynamic mechanical problems, as well as in the interpretation and analysis of results. Students will learn the place of numerical software in the design workflow and will graduate with practical skills in analysis.",

Quantifying the reaction forces and moments during gait are looked at in detail, and normative data for a number of populations are discussed and compared. Within practical classes, students will have the opportunity to collect three-dimensional motion capture data and will practice how to analyse and interpret the data they collect using skills learnt in lectures. Students will also learn about the role of anthropometry in ergonomics and sports performance, and will learn how to obtain body segment properties from anthropometric tables.",

This subject will use a series of motivating and in-depth case studies that span a range of biophysical contexts with emphasis on applications relevant to tropical systems. Statistical programming (R) and single-variable calculus will be employed in the formulation and analysis of models, and their application to empirical data. This is a core subject for all students in the Bachelor of Science-Advanced and is recommended for all students in the Bachelor of Science who intend to transfer to the Advanced program after first year. Students majoring in Mathematics and Physics in the BSc are also encouraged to enrol.",

A member of the academic staff within the College of Science and Engineering will assume overall responsibility for the student, although a PhD student, research fellow or a collaborating researcher at an external organisation may supervise the day-to-day activities of the student. The research will be of a size and scope that can be completed in 100 hours and introduces the student to methods and techniques that have current relevance to their discipline and career in science. Students are responsible for finding their own supervisors before their enrolment into the subject is permitted. Email confirmation from the supervisor of \"consent to supervise, an intended study period of enrolment\" should be sent to the subject coordinator to initiate enrolment into this subject.
