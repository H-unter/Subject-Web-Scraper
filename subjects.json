We will examine the origins and organisation of all this life, and learn the principles that allow you to make sense of biodiversity. In lectures, we will expose you to the vital basic knowledge required for understanding scientific principles of plant and animal biology, which is designed as an introduction allowing you to conduct more advanced and specialised studies later. In the laboratories, you will review these principles, and be exposed to examples of biodiversity in all its wonder and complexity. You will learn the basic features of animals and plants.",

The Western medical scientific paradigm is situated philosophically and historically as a culturally informed knowledge system to be considered comparatively. Through case studies drawn from around the world, the subject explores issues such as human-technology relationships, global health programs, drug use, addiction and mental health, theories of bodies and minds, shamanism and traditional healing practices, and the consequences of inequality on health.",

How are cities imagined in film and popular culture? How is public space used and by whom? What struggles exist for the future of life in the city? Lectures and discussions cover a range of topics including urban design, memory and heritage, development and gentrification, artistic practice and public space, citizenship, social justice and sustainability. Students are introduced to critical theories of urban space, and have the opportunity to engage this theory by conducting their own fieldwork on city life.",

Students will explore why humans create and articulate myths, and the significance of common themes in myths from different cultural, geographical and historical contexts. Theories concerning the relationship between myth and ritual and the importance of ritual as a special type of human individual and collective practice are examined. Topics covered include contemporary issues of religious conflict and violence, religion and ecological crisis, the role that myth, ritual and religious experiences play in human responses to sickness, death and uncertainty, the aesthetics of ritual symbolism, the power of ritual objects, and the efficacy of ritual performances, such as in initiation rites, healing rites, trance, sacrifice, spirit possession, shamanism, witchcraft, sorcery, and rituals of the state.",

It addresses contentious issues such as wild resource harvesting, the physical effects of aquaculture, aquaculture wastes, disease and parasites, and the impacts of introductions and escapees. It also addresses how to develop and implement sustainable aquaculture systems. Therefore, as a result of studying this subject, students will be able to critically assess the environmental sustainability and suitability of existing and developing aquaculture industries, as well as quantify the benefits of sustainable aquaculture practices. This subject integrates field and laboratory based learning so that students benefit from varied circumstances, contact and settings. Each day of this intensive is centred around one main sustainability theme which is delivered by experts in that area. The course coordinator has considerable experience in the aquaculture industry, and aquatic animal health.",

During the first lectures of this subject we introduce you to the tools and techniques of the practical archaeologist. We then move on to consider the biggest question in archaeology (and related disciplines) - As a species, how did we get to be what we are today? We begin by investigating our evolutionary origins in tropical Africa and explanations of how our ancestors then colonised the world while at the same time developing physically and intellectually into us. Using case studies from different regions of the world, we investigate past lifestyles and adaptations. Further key questions include: Why did some human societies take up farming? Why did some human societies go on to develop the early urban societies from which our modern (human) world has emerged?",

This subject provides a critical and global review of the kinds of evidence that can be used to study the people of the past and the investigative techniques and interpretative approaches that can be applied to such evidence. The subject will include reviews of burial practices and burial places; the kinds of human remains represented in the archaeological record; indirect sources of evidence; excavation methods and post-excavation treatment of human material; DNA, forensic and palaeopathological studies; anatomical reconstructions; palaeodemography and human remains as heritage. Significant emphasis is placed on the ethical, legal and moral issues that must be addressed in the recovery, study and treatment of human remains.

The subject then traces increasing social complexity in this region, especially in the Yellow River valley, through to the partly mythical Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties. After a consideration of the First Emperor's short but defining reign, the subject then compares what happened in China with how and why similar urban-based civilisations developed in tropical Southeast Asia.",

In exploring the concept of 'Our Space' we examine the importance of networks to place-making, and the power relations involved in such networks. We investigate how networks locate us, and how narratives of space and place flow through networks of communication and exchange. We also examine how networks not only shape our identities, but also the ways we experience our place in the world. Throughout the study period we will investigate, via narratives and thought-provoking case studies, how the contemporary networked world has a long history, and we will evaluate the impact of such networks on space and the making of place.",

        "description": "This subject introduces the regulatory systems in cells and organisms which form the basis for pharmacology. It builds on the material covered in the two 1st semester subject BC2013, by addressing how multicellular organisms can control and integrate their metabolic processes and how cells interrelate and communicate with each other. It also shows how disturbances in these processes cause disease and how these pathogenic processes can be normalized by therapeutic drugs. The subject begins with detailed descriptions of the molecular structure and function of biological membranes. Transport across or within biomembranes is an important feature that underpins our understanding of how proteins and drugs move between cells and within a cell. This is the basis of regulation at the metabolic pathway level and is important in understanding the mode of action of many drugs. The subject explores the functions of enzymes, how they work at the molecular level and how inhibitors may interfere with their action. Regulation at the cellular level is explored in detail, examining how signals are communicated at the cell surface to invoke downstream intracellular molecular events, how nerve cells communicate and how cell surface receptors interact with agonists and antagonists. This includes examples of specific molecular ligand-receptor interactions both clinically and those that have been exploited in drug development. Also covered are the major cellular processes, the cell cycle and cell death. Therapeutic and vaccine failure in modern day drug discovery & delivery is explored. This course of lectures should therefore give you a balanced view of how cells are controlled, how they communicate with each other and how chemical agents are able to alter cellular processes.",

Topics covered include intracellular structures, signal transduction, protein sorting and translocation, the cytoskeleton, the cell cycle, apoptosis, molecular immunology and the molecular biology of cancer. Advanced cell biology is important to a wide range of current biomedical and genetic research because it describes much of the biochemical basis for modern treatment and prophylaxis approaches. The lectures and practical sessions of this subject are focused on providing a background in molecular biomedicine to compete effectively in the job market. The first half of semester covers the structures and biochemistry of basic cell functions (division, death, movement, production and responsiveness) while the second half integrates this knowledge to develop a working understanding of the molecular bases of four complex biological systems: tumour biology, disease, immune responses to foreign proteins (allergies) and to infectious diseases (parasites).The subject concludes with a look to the past leading to emerging technologies and their impact on the field of biomedical science.",

We begin with some basic cell biology which underpins cellular function. We will then discuss the classification, structure and growth of the major groups of microbes and the processes by which they are transmitted to, and subsequently cause disease in the host. You will develop a broad understanding of immune function as we will also investigate the mechanisms by which the host fights back following invasion by these microbes. Practical sessions introduce you to basic microbiological techniques, including aseptic technique, microbial staining and microscopy and immunological assays.",

The general principles of pathobiology are covered with particular reference to the changes at the level of cells, tissues and organs such as necrosis, inflammation, repair, haemostasis, genetic disorders and neoplasia. This subject will explore the basic concepts of physiology and pathology to explain how the normal functioning of the human body can become altered in the disease state. Disorders affecting major organ systems in the body, namely the renal, endocrine, reproductive and gastrointestinal will be studied. Having examined the basis for abnormal function in disease, we then explore how drug treatments may be used to help restore normal function. In addition to the theoretical basis for drug intervention, the practical considerations of managing these treatments will also be discussed.",

In lectures, we will expose you to the vital basic knowledge required for understanding scientific principles of plant and animal biology, which is designed as an introduction allowing you to conduct more advanced and specialised studies later. In the laboratories, you will review these principles, and be exposed to examples of biodiversity in all its wonder and complexity. You will learn the basic features of animals and plants.",

It influences every aspect of an organism's form and behaviour, and therefore is important for every field of biology, from marine and terrestrial biology and ecology through to conservation, aquaculture, molecular genetics, and even human health. This subject examines the evolutionary processes that have given rise to the diversity of life on earth; including the diversification and adaptation of populations to their surrounding environments and the rise of new species. Theory and techniques derived from evolutionary biology underpin many other fields in biology, and are being increasingly used in the conservation and management of threatened species and ecosystems. Knowledge of evolutionary processes is therefore essential for understanding and predicting how organisms will respond to increasing anthropogenic pressures and global change.",

In microeconomics, the subject introduces the economic principles of demand and supply which are fundamental to understanding market outcomes and government intervention in particular markets (for example to provide social services/protection, environmental protection or to stop anti-competitive market behaviour). In macroeconomics, the subject introduces the principles of economic growth and the tools governments use to steer economic growth (both in the short and long run) or make that growth more sustainable and inclusive. Understanding the principles of economics allows students to anticipate the behaviour of market agents (be they individuals, firms or governments), which is an important skill to any student, not the least those pursuing a career in business.",

The subject is designed to integrate knowledge and skills developed throughout the degree in a practical workplace setting by undertaking an approved industry placement. Students are required to complete a minimum 100 hours of productive work which aligns with their major. Existing workplaces are not an option for BU3101 internships. Students who are in paid employment should apply for BU3103 Independent Project. Students cannot self-enrol, but must apply and be granted permission to enrol in the subject. Application deadlines are communicated to eligible students via their jcu email prior to the start of each study period. Students who successfully secure an internship and who do not fulfil the agreed conditions of internship and subsequently fail to deliver for their industry partner are not permitted to re-apply or to re-enrol in BU3101. However, students can still gain valuable industry experience by undertaking BU3102 Multidisciplinary Project. More information on the Business WIL options and the application process is available via the WIL Organisation on LearnJCU. Students should contact enrolments@jcu.edu.au if unsure of their eligibility for WIL. Students at JCUB and JCUS should consult Academic Staff.",

The subject starts with the research design process and then delves into quantitative methods used to isolate cause and effect in the presence of (potentially unobserved) confounding relationships. Confounding relationships are endemic to health and social science research. Experimental data collection is the preferred method, however it is often unfeasible or unethical. Alternatives include matching, difference-in-differences, instrumental variable and regression discontinuity analysis. Students will learn how these methods neutralize the effects of confounders, which of these methods to use under which circumstances and apply that knowledge analysing big (cross-sectional) data sets. Findings from this type of quantitative research are often crucial elements in decision-making processes in business (ex-ante cost benefit analysis), public policy (social return on investment analysis) and public health policy (cost effectiveness analyses).",

It provides students with a multi-faceted understanding of consumer decision-making by exploring emotions, learning and memory, personality, motivation, perception, attitudes and behavioural change, groups and consumer tribes. In addition, it considers gender identity, beauty ideals and concepts of self, and hence explores the role that products and services play in shaping people's identities. Furthermore, the subject differentiates between ethical and unethical behaviours by both consumers and organisations. This subject will provide students with the opportunity to apply leading-edge theories, models and frameworks to the development of marketing strategy and hence demonstrate 'work-ready' knowledge appropriate to a career in marketing, corporate settings, government and community groups.",

It outlines marketing benefits, but also addresses its potentially negative influence on consumers and society, such as consumerism and waste, the promotion of materialistic values, global trade that relies on the exploitation of labour and scarce resources, climate change, and the destruction of the natural environment. Subsequently, the subject adopts a systems approach to understanding the complex interactions between the environmental, economic and social dimensions of sustainability. The subject concludes by examining the contribution that 'villain marketing', together with business and government, can make to create positive change for sustainability and address the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

The subject covers a range of areas that relate to employments systems and the dynamics between employees, workplaces, and the legal, social and political paradigms and the processes that govern these systems. Students will become familiar with the various stakeholders and gain knowledge and understanding of the interplay of these stakeholders as they create a complex and continually evolving system that is equally immersed in historical and cultural employment traditions and ideologies while propelling students to think about the future nature of work and workplaces. In addition, students will develop an awareness of the implications of current and emerging changes in employment systems on the management of workplaces and the respective employees, including paid and volunteer workers. As students develop a critical appreciation of the concepts and theories relating to employment relations, they will acquire the skills and knowledge to manage and lead in contemporary and future workplaces.",

It introduces the role of multinational corporations and the complexity of international operations and management, and discusses current debates surrounding multilateral bodies. Reasons for the emergence of globalisation and the internationalisation of business are considered along with emergent business strategies and organisational forms appropriate to international business. Trade policies of a number of important trading partners are examined through the application of a trade poster. International business entry modes and the impact of cultural differences on doing business overseas are analysed. Students will need to demonstrate skills in gathering and evaluating data, from both printed and internet sources, and developing a strategic business approach in analysing international business case studies. Students will gain from this subject an appreciation of the multifaceted nature of trade in a globalised trading system.",

These operations can be seen as falling into two categories: (1) those directly linked to tourist experiences such as tours and attractions including such components as theme parks, local area short tours, museums, historic sites, and leisure activity centres, and (2) those that support tourism and hospitality experiences such as accommodation, restaurants, tour booking services, transport, and shopping.

Topics presented include population growth, species interactions, community patterns and dynamics, food webs and the effects of disturbance and scaling on diversity. In addition to an increased understanding of concepts, students gain hands-on experience in tropical research.",

The organic chemistry section will introduce general features of organic reactions, will discuss selected reaction mechanisms, will provide experimental and instrumental techniques for structure determination and will cover the stereochemistry of hydrocarbons. The physical chemistry section will discuss principles of chemical kinetics, will introduce redox and electrochemistry, will describe intramolecular forces and will cover gas laws. The inorganic chemistry section will introduce atomic structure, will discuss bonding and periodicity, will cover chemistry in nature and industry including metallurgy, chemical manufacturing and cycling of elements through the environment. It will also present systematic chemistry of selected groups of the Periodic Table and aspects of the chemistry of the transition metals including their role in biological systems.",

Designing and operating safe and sustainable systems that enhance society and the environment in which those systems are situated, are key skills that must be developed. The genesis of those skills find their place in the undergraduate curriculum, and are especially focussed upon in this subject. CL4040 is divided into two halves. The first is concerned with developing the skill of risk management for decision making to analyse, assess and improve the safety characteristics of socio-technical chemical process systems. This includes learning from past accidents in the chemical industry, hazard identification, quantitative consequence and frequency analyses, evaluating risk and making a design as to how to treat the risk. Safety risk assessment and treatment involves consideration of inherently safer design principles. Importantly, the limitations to the effectiveness of traditional risk assessment practices will be discussed, to encourage the students to develop a realistic appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of the tools they are using. The second half of the subject focusses on environmental impacts and sustainability. It is designed to develop students with skills in life cycle assessment, pollution control technologies in air, water and land. It also covers the basic philosophy, principles and practical guidelines for sustainable development of industries. A key theme running through this subject is to make the students aware of their responsibilities as an engineer across safety, environment and sustainability issues and practices.",

Through projects, students will develop problem-solving skills, communication skills, presentation skills, project management skills and also build creative systems for a range of applications. Students will learn basic approaches to creative group problem solving working in teams in the form of a \"sprint\" event. The Sprint environment will provide students with an opportunity to develop these skills via a short-term 2-day design sprint to collectively analyse a problem then design and partially implement a practical solution, which is a mandatory part of this subject.",

Capstone subjects allow students to apply and integrate the knowledge, skills and capabilities learned throughout their Bachelor of Information Technology degree while at the same time fostering the development of professional identities and transition to the workplace. Identification of suitable projects occurs through collaboration between the College and industry partner organisations. Students work in groups of up to six with each group having a mix of majors. Students are advised of their allocated group in the first timetabled workshop. It is a requirement that students attend the 3 hour timetabled workshop each week. Students conduct project work in addition to this contact time and receive support and project direction from academics and industry partner for the project's duration. External students are not eligible to enrol in this subject. Students at JCUS should consult Academic Staff.",

The concept of 'responsive governance' is also being explored. In a rapidly changing cyber risk environment, in fact, the policies and procedures of today are not necessarily valid for long periods of time and may not remain valid between typical annual review cycles, hence students need to learn how to adapt to an ever evolving scenario.",

Students will learn fundamental theory of numerical methods in engineering and will learn to apply such methods in the analysis of various thermal, fluid, static and dynamic mechanical problems. Some complementary numerical theory and application sections will be taught in parallel during the semester to provide context for one another and provide an introduction to some of the numerical tools available to today's engineers. Within the theory section of the subject, students will learn the fundamentals and implementation of the finite element method (FEM). In the application part of the subject, students will be trained in the use of the ANSYS commercial FEM package for static and dynamic problems, as well as in the interpretation and analysis of results.

The main theories of crime prevention (eg routine activity, crime pattern and rational choice) inform criminal justice policy strategies at several levels of intervention - primary, secondary and tertiary. Community safety programmes tend to be collaborative and localised in nature, and are intended to be democratically empowering. This subject also examines practical elements of programme design, implementation and evaluation through the selective use of local and international case studies.",

This allows the development of competency in procedures which are examined at the end of Year 4. This includes further exposure to the disciplines focused on children (Paedodontics and Orthodontics), adults (Restorative, Periodontics and Endodontics) and Gerodontics and Oral Medicine. The cross-age disciplines of Oral Surgery and Restorative Dentistry are a strong focus of the clinical program. This dental specific content is augmented by a medicine and surgery component and has a strong ethical base. The development of clinical skills continues across the year to achieve competencies in all the key areas of dentistry. Ethical, evidence-based practice is reinforced throughout Year 4 as students deepen their theoretical and applied knowledge about research in dental science. Groups of students build on earlier studies by designing a research project and developing an ethics application.",

Students continue to participate in the clinical program that exposes them to the provision of general dental clinical care, including disciplines focused on children (Paedodontics and Orthodontics) and adults (Gerodontics and Oral Medicine). An important part of the subject is the management of people with special needs. The cross-age disciplines of Oral Surgery and Restorative Dentistry remain a strong core focus of the clinical program. The development of clinical skills continues across the year to achieve competencies in all the key areas of dentistry. The research strand of DS4102:12 Clinical Dentistry 3 continues to reinforce the research processes, principles, methods and skills required for evidence based practice in dental science. In this subject, groups of students conduct the research projects designed in DS4101:12 Clinical Dentistry 2. The students will give presentations of their study results.",

Pre-service teachers also engage in a range of assessment practices and examine moderation and its application to support consistent and comparable judgements of children's learning. Topics covered in this subject include components of teaching writing, genre, punctuation, and grammar, as well as exploring children's literature and other multimodal texts. Pre-service teachers plan sequenced learning experiences with the ultimate goal being that children from diverse backgrounds will become writers and communicators.",

Plants and controllers are modelled using the z-transform which leads to rational transfer functions allowing for the usual pole/zero terminology and system performance specification and analysis. <b>Section B</b> - Modern Controller Design: Uses modern (time-domain state space) techniques in the analysis and design of controllers for continuous time plants. This section starts with developing state models of systems from both physical properties and transfer functions. It then investigates techniques for the design of controllers for systems that are modelled in state-space form such as the pole-placement technique. Associated with this are the concepts of controllability, observability and state feedback controller design",

Systems Engineering is a rigorous, repeatable and methodical approach to solving the complex technical problems often encountered in industry and beyond. The approach starts with an identification of a problem and the need for a new or improved system to be developed. This problem is explored and understood before the requirements for the new or improved system are to be developed and then analysed and articulated clearly. Potential solutions to the problem are then identified and evaluated against the requirements before a preferred solution is selected for subsequent design and development. Systems Engineering is a multi-disciplinary and collaborative approach to engineering and aims to develop solutions that not only meet requirements but are also balanced across the entire system lifecycle (including production, utilisation, support and disposal phases). Systems Engineering also closely links and integrates with non-technical disciplines and in particular Project Management. Project Management methodology and tools and techniques are explored through project life cycle and phases; activity networks; time management; cost management; physical resource management; quality management; contract management; project monitoring, information and control systems and sustainable practices",

        "description": "Students will learn fundamental theory of numerical methods in engineering and will learn to apply such methods in the analysis of various thermal, static and dynamic mechanical problems. The complementary numerical theory and application sections will be taught in parallel during the semester to provide context for one another and to expose graduates to the wide variety of numerical tools available to today's engineers. Within the theory section of the subject, students will learn the fundamentals and implementation of a variety of numerical methods; specifically the finite element method (FEM) and the discrete element method (DEM). The main topics of FEM include: matrix analysis methods; the derivation of element stiffness matrices of spring and bar elements as well as stiffness matrices of quadrilateral elements for plane elasticity, shell and solid elements; work equivalent forces; the concept of natural coordinates and isoparametric element formulation; numerical integration and gauss points and for DEM include: introduction to DEM and its applications, hard particle collision dynamics in DEM, classic and regularized Coulomb laws. Students are exposed to the theory underlying the FEM and DEM. Therefore, upon successful completion of this subject students can conceptualize alternative FEM and DEM procedures for different projects and ensure that used methods are based on fundamental principles. In the application proportion of the subject, students will be trained in the use of the ANSYS commercial FEM package for static and dynamic mechanical problems, as well as in the interpretation and analysis of results. Students will learn the place of numerical software in the design workflow and will graduate with practical skills in analysis.",

You will gain experience in applying mathematical models to real-world problems, by going through the steps of the modelling cycle: from translating a societal or scientific question into a mathematical model to analysing the model and interpreting the results in the context of the original problem.

Students will also learn about the mechanics of specific structures within the human body such as bone, joints, and skeletal muscle. Once students have examined these specific structures, the functional aspects of the upper extremity, lower extremity, and back are investigated. The causes of common injuries and the resulting biomechanical and anatomical adaptations are discussed along with the effects of aging. Students will also learn how to quantify load at the major joints and basic discussion around how this knowledge can be used is undertaken.",

Students will be placed within research teams within the university or with one of its external partners, where they will complete a small research project. The research may be field or laboratory based. A member of the academic staff within the College of Science and Engineering will assume overall responsibility for the student, although a PhD student, research fellow or a collaborating researcher at an external organisation may supervise the day-to-day activities of the student. The research will be of a size and scope that can be completed in 100 hours and introduces the student to methods and techniques that have current relevance to their discipline and career in science. Students are responsible for finding their own supervisors before their enrolment into the subject is permitted. Email confirmation from the supervisor of \"consent to supervise, an intended study period of enrolment\" should be sent to the subject coordinator to initiate enrolment into this subject. Ideally, students should start looking for supervisors in their first or second year of study to ensure they have a plan before commencing their final year",
